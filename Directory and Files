What is u+x?
u+x means: Add execute permission to the user (owner) only, without touching other permissions. It adds the execute bit to the existing permissions of the user. (like if user has 600 permision)

here if we change from 600 to 700 user will have execute permission but it will change the permission on Group and Others.

SO that is a different using +x, it will add to specific without affeting existing permission for group and others.

u+x    = user specific

g+x    = Group specific

0+x    = Other specific


"u+x is a user permission, u+s is a file behavior setting."

✅ In other words:
u+x = lets a user run a file

u+s = makes the file run as the owner
